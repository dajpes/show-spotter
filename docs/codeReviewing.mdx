# Code Reviewing Process

Documenting our team standards for code reviews, version control, and release gates.

## Jira Integration

Every Pull Request correlates to a Jira User Story. This creates a traceable link between requirements and implementation.

- **Branch Naming**: Prefix branches with the ticket ID (e.g., `SP-5`).
- **PR Title**: Start with the Jira ID (e.g., `SP-5: Add Favorites Functionality`).
- **PR Message**: Please follow the instructions set in the PR template.

## Trunk-Based Development

We follow a Trunk-Based Development strategy.

- **Main Branch**: The `main` branch is the single source of truth. It must essentially be deployable at any time.
- **Short-Lived Branches**: Feature branches should be merged back into `main` frequently to minimize merge conflicts.

## Approval Workflow

We enforce strict gates to maintain stability in `main`:

1.  **Peer Review**: A minimum of **two approvals** from engineering peers are required.
2.  **QA Sign-off**: After code approval, the ticket enters QA validation.
    - Merging to `main` happens **only after** QA explicitly marks the ticket as verified. Product and / or design can also provide further input before merging.
    - If issues are found, fixes are committed to the existing feature branch.

## Review Checklist

Key areas to focus on during review:

- **Logic**: Does the code solve the problem correctly?
- **Architecture**: Adherence to project patterns (Redux usage, folder structure).
- **Performance**: Avoiding unnecessary re-renders or heavy computations.
- **Readability**: Variable naming and code structure.
- **Testing**: Presence of unit/integration tests for new logic.
